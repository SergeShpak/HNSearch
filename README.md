# HNSearch

HNSearch is a utility that extracts data on the [Hacker News](#https://news.ycombinator.com/) queries.

The user can extract data on the queries that were made during a specific time period. In particular, the user can:
1. get the number of distinct queries
2. get the most popular queries

The user can extract data only for the queries stored in a dump file. The current dump contains the requests made between **2015-08-01 00:03:43** and **2015-08-04 05:52:16**.
